Give me three interesting bullet point facts about the moon.

1. The Moon has no atmosphere, which means that there is no wind or weather on the Moon. This makes it an ideal place for spacecraft to land and explore without worrying about turbulence or changes in temperature.
2. The Moon is moving away from Earth at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters (1.5 inches) per year. This means that if you were to travel back in time to the moment when the Moon formed, it would be much closer to Earth than it is today.
3. The far side of the Moon, sometimes called the "dark side," is actually not dark all the time. In fact, there are periods of daylight and darkness just like on Earth, but the phases are opposite to those on Earth because the Moon takes about 27.3 days to complete one rotation on its axis. This means that the far side of the Moon experiences a "day" every 14 days, followed by a "night" that lasts for 14 days.
